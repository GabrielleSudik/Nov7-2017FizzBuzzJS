        Play Fizz Buzz!

    you DON'T have it written with script tags, so it won't run here (yet)-->

    <!--//document.getElementById("something").innerHTML = "Hey baby"
    //you typed that to test it.
    //let's make it easier to read
    //remember -- later actions override earlier actions-->

    var myButton = document.getElementById("btn");
    <!--//alert(fizzBuzz());
    //we tried it with alert the first time
    //it worked, so we coded out the alert

    //we created the variable "results" AFTER you finished fizzBuzz
    //it's an easy way to "hold" the product of that function
    //so when you tinker with it later, it's easier to track/type-->

    var results = fizzBuzz();
    <!--//that line alone just makes everything from fizzBuzz into its own variable
    //ie, the "results" of fizzBuzz
    //alert(results); //again, that just tested it

    //IMPORTANT-- this next function is the LAST thing you wrote
    //you wrote the "big" fizzbuzz function first,
    //then made its results a variable
    //then made this method to send those results to the html area called "printMe"
    //whee-->
